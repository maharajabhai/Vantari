# Closed-Loop Photobiomodulation Earpiece

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a closed-loop photobiomodulation device in the form of an earpiece. The device uses a 1550nm pulsed LED for cochlear penetration and incorporates various sensors to create an intelligent, adaptive system for photobiomodulation therapy.

## Features

- 1550nm pulsed LED for targeted photobiomodulation
- Closed-loop system with real-time physiological monitoring
- Multiple sensor inputs:PPG (heart rate), temperature
- Arduino-based control system
- Data logging and analysis capabilities

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Nano
- ThorLabs 1550nm laser diode
- PPG sensor
- Temperature sensor

## Software Dependencies

- Arduino IDE
- Custom Arduino libraries (list specific libraries if used)
- Data analysis scripts (Python/MATLAB, specify as appropriate)
